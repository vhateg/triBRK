# triBRK
tri-Button Rhythm Keyboard is a cheap and simple to produce input device for various rythm games, aiming to fill the niche of three button devices

Built around a STM32 "blue-pill", it uses cheap commonly available parts and a 3D printed case. Unlike AVR-based alternatives, this is even cheaper, as blue-pills are around 3-4 euro on Chinese websites.
